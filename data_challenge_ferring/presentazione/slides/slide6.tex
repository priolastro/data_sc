    All the calculation have been performed with python (refer to nb for libraries version )
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Simple Linear regression (LR)
            \item Ridge Linear regression (LR\_R)
            \item Support Vector regression (SVR) (with grid search for best parameters)
        \end{itemize}
    Other methods tried (reported in the nootebook, not discussed further in this presentation because of the poor performance and/or the longer training time)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Random Forest regressor
        \item Bagging regressor
        \item Gradient Boosting regressor
        \item StackingRegressor (with Ridge and Support vector regression)
    \end{itemize}
