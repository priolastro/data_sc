    \frametitle{Prediction}
    Is not possible to make prediction if the number of feautures available in the prediction set is different from the number of feautures used to train the model. For this reason:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The common wavelengths between the prediction data set and training data set have been selected (considering only integer part -- i.e. 1124 in CAL500 is considered the same as 1124.47 in VAL\_HSI) 
        \item 101 common feautures have been found
        \item The model is trained again in the same way as found with the complete training data set
        \item The predictions are obtained for each of the 80 samples averaging all the avalilabe 400 measures
    \end{itemize}
    The final predictions can be found in the \texttt{Predictions\_SalvatorePrioli.csv} file.
