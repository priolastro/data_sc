    \frametitle{Data set description}
    In the data set provided can be found:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{The training data}: a collection of 500 samples for which \textit{yref} has been measured along a spectrum in the interval 1100-2498 \textit{nm} (2 \textit{nm} stride)
        \item \textbf{The validation data}: a collection of 80 samples for which \textit{yref} must be determined based on 400 repeated spectra in the interval 1118.19-2424.92 nm (6.28nm stride)
    \end{itemize}
    The training set and the validation set are sampled at different wavelengths.
