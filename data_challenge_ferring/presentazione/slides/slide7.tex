    Model with low error (MAE, MSE, RMSE) and high $R^2$ are preferred. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item low error - high confidence predicting testing data; high $R^2$ - high total variance explained by the model
        \item SVR (with grid search) is the best model (probably due to the underlying linear law govening the relation reinforced by the supporting vectors) 
        \item Other important metrics are AIC, AICc, BIC (\href{https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13193794}{Singh et al., 2021})
    \end{itemize}
